Process: Provided with hourly renting data span of two years was used to predict the total count of cabs booked in each hour covered by the test set, using the information available prior to the booking period.

Task 1: 1.Visualize data using different visualizations to generate interesting insights. 2.Outlier Analysis 3.Missing value analysis 4.Visualizing Total_booking Vs other features to generate insights 5.Correlation Analysis
Task 2: 1.Feature Engineering 2.Grid search 3.Regression Analysis 4.Ensemble Model
